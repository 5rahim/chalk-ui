<h2 align="center">Chalk UI</h2>

<h4 align="center">Opinionated and flexible React components, styled with TailwindCSS, built for Next.js SaaS applications.</h4>

## Why?

Chalk components are mainly built around Radix UI primitives with an additional layer of abstraction to make them easier to use and provide
more functionality out of the box.
Additionally, Chalk provides a broader range of components tailored for SaaS applications while
keeping a consistent design language and API.

## Features

- Stable foundation around Radix UI
- Broad range of components tailored for SaaS applications
- Higher-level API for Radix UI primitives
- Consistent design language and API
- Usage of battle-tested libraries
- Customizable with TailwindCSS
- 100% TypeScript
