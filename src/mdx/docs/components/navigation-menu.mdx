## Installation

```bash
npx @rahimstack@latest add navigation-menu
```

## Usage

NavigationMenu is based on the [NavigationMenu Primitive](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu) from Radix UI.

On small screens, the menu is collapsed into a hamburger button, which triggers a drawer containing the menu items rendered using a [VerticalMenu](/docs/components/vertical-menu) component.
- You can customize the drawer by passing a `mobileDrawerProps` prop to the component.
- Additionally, you can add content to the drawer by passing `mobileDrawerHeader` and `mobileDrawerContent` props to the component.
