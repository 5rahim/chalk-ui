## Init

Read the **Installation** section to complete the configuration.

- ✅ Select the components you want to install.
- ✅ Automatically adds shared components.
- ✅ Installs dependencies or updates package.json.
- ✅ Updates tailwind.config.js and globals.scss.


Caveats:
- `init` should only be run once.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui init
```

Options:
- `--all`: Skip component selection and add all of them.

## Add

- ✅ This command will add the components you pass as argument.
- ✅ Detects and adds shared components.
- ✅ Installs dependencies or updates package.json.

Caveats:
- It will not add a component that already exists.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui add [...components]
```

## Update

<Alert
    intent="info"
    description={"This command will only work if you did not change the structure and names of component files and directories."}
/>

- ⚠️ Do not use this command to update components that you have heavily modified the logic or layout of.
- ⚠️ Changes made to a component's logic or layout will be **overwritten**.
- ⚠️ Make sure you take note of components with breaking changes. [CHANGELOG.md](/docs/changelog).

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui@latest update
```

- The command will traverse all files and look for outdated files.
- If a file is outdated, the command will create a new, temporary file in the UI directory called `TEMP_<filename>.(ext)`
- You will see three options: **merge**, **skip** and **show diff**.
    - You can use the **show diff** option to see the differences between the old and new file.
    - Modify the temporary file to your liking (e.g. copy/paste your styles) and use the **merge** option to merge the changes.

## Remove

- ✅ Removes component files and directories.
- ✅ Uninstalls dependencies that are not used by any other component.
- ✅ It will not remove unused shared components.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui remove [...components]
```

## Clean

- ✅ This command will remove all components and uninstall their dependencies.

Caveats:
- ⚠️ This can uninstall dependencies that you use elsewhere.
- ⚠️ The **tailwind.config.js** and **globals.scss** files will not be removed.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui clean
```
