# Customization

## Theming

- A lot of components are designed with the `brand` color variant defined in tailwind.config.js.
By customizing the brand color, you can ensure that these components align with your desired visual identity and branding.

- Some components such as Button, Badge and Alert have a `intent` property, which features different colors in their styling such as `primary` (which is the brand color).
They also have other intents like `success`, `alert` and `warning`.

- You can also modify `globals.scss` to adjust dark mode colors or the common radius value.


## Styling

- You should be familiar with Tailwind before using these components.

### Anatomy

Most components are designed with an "anatomy" paradigm. The anatomy approach defines the main parts of the component's styling using a function called `defineStyleAnatomy`.<br/>
- Each part is represented by a distinct class-variance-authority (CVA) function. These functions define the Tailwind classes associated with each part of the component.
- For example, the **PageHeader** component has several parts such as `body`, `title`, `description`, etc..., each with its own styling.
- CVA offers features like `variants` and `compoundVariants`. [Learn more about CVA](https://cva.style/docs/getting-started).

I decided to decouple the Tailwind classes and the components to allow for re-usability and updatability.
In fact, the CLI's `upgrade` command will ignore the anatomy section of a component and only update the logic in the event that you customized the styling.


### className props

The alternative approach involves passing various className props to a component, allowing targeted customization using Tailwind classes.

In this approach, the component accepts className props for each part of the anatomy, such as `titleClassName`, `bodyClassName`, `descriptionClassName`, and so on.
- We infer the className props from the anatomy using the `defineStyleAnatomy` function paired with the `ComponentWithAnatomy` helper type. We then merge the classes in the corresponding space using the
`cn` function.

These className props can be used to add or overwrite Tailwind classes for the corresponding parts of the component's anatomy.

```tsx
// src/components/ui/page-header/PageHeader.tsx

export const PageHeaderAnatomy = defineStyleAnatomy({
    // Defines `title` Tailwind classes
    title: cva("UI-PageHeader__title font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200", {
        variants: {
            size: { // Size variant
                sm: "text-lg sm:text-xl",
                md: "text-xl sm:text-2xl",
                lg: "text-2xl sm:text-3xl",
                xl: "text-2xl sm:text-4xl",
            },
        },
        defaultVariants: {
            size: "xl",
        },
    }),
    ...
})

export interface PageHeaderProps extends
    React.ComponentPropsWithRef<"div">,
    ComponentWithAnatomy<typeof PageHeaderAnatomy>, // Provides className props
    VariantProps<typeof PageHeaderAnatomy.title>    // Provides `size` variant
{
   title?: string,
   ...
}

export const PageHeader = (props) => {
   const {
        title,
        size,           // Size prop from CVA variant
        titleClassName, // Classname prop from `ComponentWithAnatomy` helper type
        ...rest
   } = props
    return <div {...}>
       ...
        {/* Merge styles */}
       <h1 className={cn(PageHeaderAnatomy.title({ size }), titleClassName)}>{title}</h1>
       ...
    </div>
}



// src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

export const Page = () => {
    return <div>
       <PageHeader
            title="Dashboard"
            size="md"                       // Change size variant
            titleClassName="font-medium"    // Overwrite `title` font weight
       />
       ...
    </div>
}
```

- TLDR; Update the anatomy classnames only if you want all subsequent uses of the component to have these changes (Adapting components to your design system).
Use the className approach if you want to localize changes (Creating variations of a component).
