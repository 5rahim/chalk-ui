# CLI

## Init

- This command will prompt you for the components you want to install.
- It will add shared components.
- It will automatically install dependencies or update package.json.
- It will overwrite tailwind.config.js and globals.scss.


Caveats:
- Ideally, `init` should only be run once.
- Ideally, you should have a `src` folder to avoid unforeseen bugs.
- Note that it will not install Tailwind or add `UIProvider` to your project.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui init
```

Arguments:
- `--all`: Install all components.

## Add

- This command will add the components you pass as argument.
- It will add shared components.
- It will not add a component that already exists.
- It will install dependencies or update package.json.

Caveats:
- You should have run `init` first.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui add [...components]
```

## Remove

- This command will remove the components you pass as argument.
- It will only uninstall dependencies that are not used by any other component.

Caveats:
- It will not remove unused shared components.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui remove [...components]
```


## Clean

- This command will remove all components and uninstall all used dependencies.

Caveats:
- This can uninstall dependencies that you use elsewhere.
- It will not change tailwind.config.js or globals.scss

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui clean
```
