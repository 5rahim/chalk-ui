# CLI

## Init

Read the **Installation** section to complete the configuration.

- ✅ Select the components you want to install.
- ✅ Shared components will be automatically added.
- ✅ Installs dependencies or updates package.json.
- ✅ Updates tailwind.config.js and globals.scss.


Caveats:
- `init` should only be run once.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui init
```

Options:
- `--all`: Skip component selection and add all of them.

## Add

- ✅ This command will add the components you pass as argument.
- ✅ It will add shared components.
- ✅ It will install dependencies or update package.json.

Caveats:
- It will not add a component that already exists.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui add [...components]
```

## Update

- ⚠️ **This command will only work if you did not change the structure and names of component files and directories.**
- ⚠️ Do not use this command to update components that you have heavily modified the logic or layout of.
- ⚠️ Changes made to a component's logic or layout will be **overwritten**.
- ⚠️ Make sure you take note of components with breaking changes. [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/5rahim/chalk-ui/blob/main/packages/chalk/CHANGELOG.md).

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui@<version> update
```

- Run the command, replace \<version\> with the desired version or "latest".
- You have the option to automatically preserves the changes you've made to the styling.
  - This will preserve all changes made to `defineStyleAnatomy` functions.
- The command will traverse all files and look for differences.
- If a file is outdated, the command will create a new, temporary file in the UI directory called `TEMP_<filename>.(tsx,json)`, containing the upcoming changes
- This approach allows you to verify upcoming changes, modify then **merge** or **skip**.
  - Merging will overwrite the local file's content with the content of the temporary file.
  - Skipping will keep the current content.

## Remove

- ✅ Removes component files and directories.
- ✅ Uninstalls dependencies that are not used by any other component.
- It will not remove unused shared components.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui remove [...components]
```

## Clean

- ✅ This command will remove all components and uninstall their dependencies.

Caveats:
- ⚠️ This can uninstall dependencies that you use elsewhere (like lodash).
- ⚠️ The **tailwind.config.js** and **globals.scss** files will stay the same

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui clean
```
