# CLI

## Init

- ✅ Select the components you want to install.
- ✅ Shared components will be automatically added.
- ✅ Installs dependencies or updates package.json.
- ✅ Updated tailwind.config.js and globals.scss.


Caveats:
- Ideally, `init` should only be run once.
- Ideally, you should have a `src` folder to avoid unforeseen bugs.
- Note that it will not install Tailwind or add `UIProvider` to your project.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui init
```

Arguments:
- `--all`: Install all components.

## Add

- ✅ This command will add the components you pass as argument.
- ✅ It will add shared components.
- ✅ It will not add a component that already exists.
- ✅ It will install dependencies or update package.json.

Caveats:
- You should have run `init` first.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui add [...components]
```

## Update

- ⚠️ **This command will only work if you did not change the structure and names of component files and directories.**
- ⚠️ Do not use this command to update components that you have heavily modified the logic or layout of.
- ⚠️ Changes made to a component's logic or layout will be **overwritten**.
- ⚠️ Make sure you take note of components with breaking changes. [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/5rahim/chalk-ui/blob/main/packages/chalk/CHANGELOG.md).

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui@<version> update
```

- Run the command, replace \<version\> with the desired version or "latest".
- You have the option to automatically preserves the changes you've made to the styling.
  - This will preserve all changes made to `defineStyleAnatomy` functions.
- The command will traverse all files and look for differences.
- If a file is outdated, the command will create a new, temporary file in the UI directory called `TEMP_<filename>.(tsx,json)`, containing the upcoming changes
- This approach allows you to verify upcoming changes, modify then **merge** or **skip**.
  - Merging will overwrite the local file's content with the content of the temporary file.
  - Skipping will keep the current content.

### Example

Let's say you want to update your `Dropzone` component.

```text
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── ui                      // Generated
│   │   │   ├── file-upload
│   │   │   │   ├── dropzone.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── helper.ts
│   │   │   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   │   │   ├── locales.json
│   │   │   │   └── use-file-upload-handler.ts
│   │   │   └── ...
```

```shell
√ Do you want to maintain your custom component styles (anatomy classes)? ... yes
Great, your anatomy functions will be preserved.
[button/index.tsx]: No difference
* Action required
[file-upload/dropzone.tsx]: Temporary file created, modify it if necessary (*)
C:\...\src\components\ui\TEMP_dropzone.tsx
√ What do you want to do? [merge, skip] ...
```

- Open `TEMP_dropzone.tsx` to check the upcoming changes. You should see that your anatomy classes have been preserved.
- If, for example, you've modified the original file icons, those changes will not be preserved.
- In that case, I recommend using a tool like [Mergely](https://editor.mergely.com/) to merge your changes with the temporary file.
- Save the changes made to `TEMP_dropzone.tsx`, then **merge** in the CLI.

```shell
* Action required
[file-upload/locales.json]: Temporary file created, modify it if necessary (*)
C:\...\src\components\ui\TEMP_locales.json
```

- In the case of a locale file, you should **skip** unless there is an addition in the upcoming changes.

## Remove

- ✅ Removes component files and directories.
- ✅ Uninstalls dependencies that are not used by any other component.

Caveats:
- It will not remove unused shared components.

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui remove [...components]
```

## Clean

This command will remove all components and uninstall all used dependencies.

Caveats:
- ⚠️ This can uninstall dependencies that you use elsewhere (like lodash).
- ⚠️ It will not change tailwind.config.js or globals.scss

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui clean
```
