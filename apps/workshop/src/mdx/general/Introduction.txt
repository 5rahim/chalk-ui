This grants you full code control, allowing customization and adaptation of components to meet your specific needs.

## Prerequisites

To ensure proper configuration with Tailwind, it is recommended to set up your application using tools such as create-next-app or other suitable templates for new projects.
Alternatively, you can manually install Tailwind by following the instructions provided in the [documentation.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

## Dependencies
