# DropdownMenu

Display accessible dropdown components with support for keyboard navigation.

Dropdown Menus are best for UI elements that resemble things like the menus you'd find in the title bar of most operating systems.
They have specific accessibility semantics, and their content should be restricted to a list of links or buttons. Focus is trapped in an open menu, so you cannot Tab through the content or away from the menu. Instead, the arrow keys navigate through a Menu's items.

## Installation

In order to install the component, run the following command:

```shell
npx @rahimstack/chalk-ui add dropdown-menu
```

## Reference

Knowing the dependencies can help you customize or extend the component with additional functionality.
