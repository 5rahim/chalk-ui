## Usage

### options

- The `options` prop expects an array of objects, where each object has a `value` and an optional `label` property.
- The `value` property represents the actual value of the option, while the `label` property represents the text to display in the dropdown.
- If the `label` property is not provided, the `value` will be used as the label.

### returnValueOrLabel

By default, the `returnValueOrLabel` prop is set to "value," meaning the selected value is returned in the `onChange` callback.
However, you can change it to "label" to receive the selected label instead.

Returning the "label" instead of the "value" provides flexibility in certain scenarios where the selected value might not be needed.
For example, it might be useful when you want to allow:
- Custom values (address input, autocomplete, ...)


## Family
