# Introduction

Chalk UI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to facilitate the seamless integration of fully-functional and completely customizable pre-made Tailwind components into your project.
With Chalk UI, you can effortlessly build or enhance your React component library by leveraging the flexibility and ownership of your code.

Why use Chalk UI?

If you find yourself dissatisfied with any aspect of a component or wish to modify its layout, Chalk UI empowers you to make those changes with ease.
By giving you complete control over the code, Chalk UI enables you to customize and adapt the components to suit your specific requirements, fostering a more efficient and tailored development process.
