# Introduction

Chalk UI is a CLI that helps you integrate fully-functional and fully-customizable Tailwind components into your existing codebase, allowing you to easily build or complement your component library.

## Why?

Don't like something or want to change the layout of a component? Do it easily because you own the code.

## Primitives

- [Zag-js](https://zagjs.com/overview/introduction) - Framework-agnostic UI component logic
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) - Unstyled, fully accessible UI primitives

## Credits

- Project inspired by **Shadcn**
- Docs design inspired by **CodeSandbox**
